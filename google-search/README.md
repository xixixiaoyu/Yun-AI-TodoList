# Google Search Tool

A Playwright-based Node.js tool that bypasses search engine anti-scraping
mechanisms to execute Google searches and extract results. It can be used
directly as a command-line tool or as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to
provide real-time search capabilities to AI assistants like Claude.

## Key Features

- **Local SERP API Alternative**: No need to rely on paid search engine results
  API services, all searches are executed locally
- **Advanced Anti-Bot Detection Bypass Techniques**:
  - Intelligent browser fingerprint management that simulates real user behavior
  - Automatic saving and restoration of browser state to reduce verification
    frequency
  - Smart headless/headed mode switching, automatically switching to headed mode
    when verification is needed
  - Randomization of device and locale settings to reduce detection risk
- **Raw HTML Retrieval**: Ability to fetch the raw HTML of search result pages
  (with CSS and JavaScript removed) for analysis and debugging when Google's
  page structure changes
- **Page Screenshot**: Automatically captures and saves a full-page screenshot
  when saving HTML content
- **MCP Server Integration**: Provides real-time search capabilities to AI
  assistants like Claude without requiring additional API keys
- **Completely Open Source and Free**: All code is open source with no usage
  restrictions, freely customizable and extensible

### Windows Environment Notes

This tool has been specially adapted for Windows environments:

1. `.cmd` files are provided to ensure command-line tools work properly in
   Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell
2. Log files are stored in the system temporary directory instead of the
   Unix/Linux `/tmp` directory
3. Windows-specific process signal handling has been added to ensure proper
   server shutdown
4. Cross-platform file path handling is used to support Windows path separators

## Usage

pnpm debug "search keywords"

# Get raw HTML of search result page
google-search "search keywords" --get-html

# Get HTML and save to file
google-search "search keywords" --get-html --save-html

      "link": "https://www.deepseek.com/",
      "snippet": "DeepSeek-R1 is now live and open source, rivaling OpenAI's Model o1. Available on web, app, and API. Click for details. Into ..."
    },
    {
      "title": "DeepSeek",
      "link": "https://www.deepseek.com/",
      "snippet": "DeepSeek-R1 is now live and open source, rivaling OpenAI's Model o1. Available on web, app, and API. Click for details. Into ..."

  ]
}
```

#### HTML Output Example

When using the `--get-html` option, the output will include information about
the HTML content:

```json
{
  "query": "playwright automation",
  "url": "https://www.google.com/",
  "originalHtmlLength": 1291733,
  "cleanedHtmlLength": 456789,
  "htmlPreview": "<!DOCTYPE html><html itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/SearchResultsPage\" lang=\"zh-CN\"><head><meta charset=\"UTF-8\"><meta content=\"dark light\" name=\"color-scheme\"><meta content=\"origin\" name=\"referrer\">..."
}
```

If you also use the `--save-html` option, the output will include the path where
the HTML was saved:

```json
{
  "query": "playwright automation",
  "url": "https://www.google.com/",
  "originalHtmlLength": 1292241,
  "cleanedHtmlLength": 458976,
  "savedPath": "./google-search-html/playwright_automation-2025-04-06T03-30-06-852Z.html",
  "screenshotPath": "./google-search-html/playwright_automation-2025-04-06T03-30-06-852Z.png",
  "htmlPreview": "<!DOCTYPE html><html itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/SearchResultsPage\" lang=\"zh-CN\">..."
}
```

### MCP Server

This project provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) server functionality,
allowing AI assistants like Claude to directly use Google search capabilities.
MCP is an open protocol that enables AI assistants to safely access external
tools and data.

```bash
# Build the project
pnpm build
```

#### Integration with Claude Desktop

1. Edit the Claude Desktop configuration file:

   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
     - Usually located at
       `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
     - You can access it directly by entering `%APPDATA%\Claude` in Windows
       Explorer address bar

2. Add server configuration and restart Claude

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["google-search-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Windows environments, you can also use the following configurations:

1. Using cmd.exe with npx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "cmd.exe",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "google-search-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Using node with full path (recommended if you encounter issues with the above
   method):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/your/google-search/dist/src/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: For the second method, you must replace `C:/path/to/your/google-search`
with the actual full path to where you installed the google-search package.

After integration, you can directly use search functionality in Claude, such as
"search for the latest AI research".

## Development Guide

All commands can be run in the project root directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install Playwright browsers
pnpm run postinstall

# Compile TypeScript code
pnpm build

# Clean compiled output
pnpm clean
```

### CLI Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
pnpm dev "search keywords"

# Run in debug mode (showing browser interface)
pnpm debug "search keywords"

# Run compiled code
pnpm start "search keywords"

# Test search functionality
pnpm test
```

### MCP Server Development

```bash
# Run MCP server in development mode
pnpm mcp

# Run compiled MCP server
pnpm mcp:build
```

## Error Handling

The tool has built-in robust error handling mechanisms:

- Friendly error messages when browser startup fails
- Automatic error status return for network connection issues
- Detailed logs for search result parsing failures
- Graceful exit and useful information return in timeout situations

## Notes

### General Notes

- This tool is for learning and research purposes only
- Please comply with Google's terms of service and policies
- Do not send requests too frequently to avoid being blocked by Google
- Some regions may require a proxy to access Google
- Playwright needs to install browsers, which will be automatically downloaded
  on first use

### State Files

- State files contain browser cookies and storage data, please keep them secure
- Using state files can effectively avoid Google's anti-bot detection and
  improve search success rate

### MCP Server

- MCP server requires Node.js v16 or higher
- When using the MCP server, please ensure Claude Desktop is updated to the
  latest version
- When configuring Claude Desktop, use absolute paths to the MCP server file

### Windows-Specific Notes

- In Windows environments, you may need administrator privileges to install
  Playwright browsers for the first time
- If you encounter permission issues, try running Command Prompt or PowerShell
  as administrator
- Windows Firewall may block Playwright browser network connections; allow
  access when prompted
- Browser state files are saved by default in the user's home directory as
  `.google-search-browser-state.json`
- Log files are stored in the system temporary directory under the
  `google-search-logs` folder

## Comparison with Commercial SERP APIs

Compared to paid search engine results API services (such as SerpAPI), this
project offers the following advantages:

- **Completely Free**: No API call fees
- **Local Execution**: All searches are executed locally, no dependency on
  third-party services
- **Privacy Protection**: Search queries are not recorded by third parties
- **Customizability**: Fully open source, can be modified and extended as needed
- **No Usage Limits**: Not subject to API call count or frequency limitations
- **MCP Integration**: Native support for integration with AI assistants like
  Claude
